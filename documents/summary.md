## Unprocessed_BarosaurusMountConstructionSpecifications--OCR.pdf

This entire document is the 40-page "Specifications for Construction" document prepared by Ralph Appelbaum Associates Incorporated Planning and Design and dated April 4, 1991.

The current (2025-05-27) version of the manuscript does not mention Appelbaum Associates at all, which seems like quite the oversight. But see the document Peter May sent, `/Users/mike/git/other/palaeo-baromount/notes/2024-11-29--call-with-peter-may/follow-up/Appelbaum Barosaurus blueprints.docx`


XXX Details to follow.

XXX I should make a table that is a timeline.



## VPA100_S3_B16_F1.pdf

This four-page handwritten document contains time and cost estimates for the personnel required for the "Renovation Group". For page 1, at least, this includes people related not just to the Barosaurus mount but to the much broader dinosaur gallery renovation project.

## Unprocessed_BarosaurusMountConstructionSpecifications--OCR.pdf

This entire document is the 40-page "Specifications for Construction" document prepared by Ralph Appelbaum Associates Incorporated Planning and Design and dated April 4, 1991.

XXX I will extract pertinent details to this document.

The current (2025-05-27) version of the manuscript does not mention Appelbaum Associates at all, which seems like quite the oversight. But see the document Peter May sent, `/Users/mike/git/other/palaeo-baromount/notes/2024-11-29--call-with-peter-may/follow-up/Appelbaum Barosaurus blueprints.docx`

XXX The manuscript should include a table that is a timeline.



## VPA100_S3_B16_F1.pdf

This four-page handwritten document contains time and cost estimates for the personnel required for the "Renovation Group". For page 1, at least, this includes people related not just to the Barosaurus mount but to the much broader dinosaur gallery renovation project.



## VPA100_S3_B28_F35.pdf

This is the concatenation of several documents.


### p1: Maxilla & Mandible quote for model (1990-03-22)

XXX


### p2: Lowell Dingus letter amending M&M quote (1990-03-28)

XXX


### p3-8: Letter of Agreement, Dingus to May/Leitch (1990-03-28)

Signed:
* 1990-03-28 (Lowell Dingus, AMNH)
* 1990-03-20 (Peter May and Andrew Leitch, RCI)
* 1990-04-03 (William J. Moynihan, AMNH)

XXX


### p9-10: Blakelock Moving to Peter May (1991-10-28)

XXX


### p11-12: Handwritten notes for navigation (undated)

XXX


### p13: Keating and co. to RCI regarding customs (1991-11-14)

XXX


### p14: AMNH Museum Shop to Maxilla & Mandible about model (1991-11-22)

XXX


### p15: Wording for Maxilla & Mandible signage (undated)

XXX Notably, this says "This bronze model is based on the mount at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City". This may have been an attachment to the letter that precedes it.


### p16-19: Maxilla & Mandible model draft publicity (1991-11-25)

Contains pages 2-5 of a fax out of order. Page 1 seems to have gone missing

XXX This refers to bronze models available to buy, the _Barosaurus_ being 12 inches tall and "collectible". This is the first I have heard of such a model.


### p20-22: Draft wording for display panel (undated)

XXX


### p23: Later draft wording for display panel (undated)

XXX


### p24-26: Mockups of display panel and ground-level exhibits (undated)

XXX


### p27-29: Melissa Posen to Peter May on Baby _Baro_ pose (undated)

XXX


### p30-31: Agreement between AMNH and RCI for animation (1995-10-30)

XXX


### p32-34: Agreement between RCI and AMNH for mini baby _Baro_ (1995-12-08)

The date "Deceber 8, 1995" in thr header is struck through.

A handwritten additional clause 9 reads "RCI agrees to deliver the finished mount no later than April 30 1996. Time is of the essence."

XXX


### p35: Note asking for comment on Agreement (undated)

XXX


### p36-38: Duplicate(?) of Agreement for baby _Baro_ (1995-12-20)

This presumably supersedes the earlier version (see later date)

Signed:
* 1995-12-21 (Peter May, RCI)
* 1995-12-28 (Lowell Dingus, AMNH)
